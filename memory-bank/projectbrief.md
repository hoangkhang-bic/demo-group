# Project Brief: Capacitor Mobile App

## Project Overview

A cross-platform mobile application built with Ionic React and Capacitor, designed to leverage native device capabilities while maintaining a single codebase.

## Core Requirements

1. Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
2. Native device feature integration
3. Modern, responsive UI using Ionic components
4. Type-safe development with TypeScript

## Project Goals

- Create a maintainable and scalable mobile application
- Optimize performance for both web and native platforms
- Ensure consistent user experience across devices
- Implement robust error handling and data validation

## Technical Stack

- React 17 for UI components
- Ionic 8.6.0 for mobile-first UI framework
- Capacitor 7.x for native platform integration
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for build tooling

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Web application development
- iOS application development
- Android application development
- Native feature integration (camera, splash screen)
- Cross-platform testing

### Out of Scope

- Backend development
- Desktop application
- Offline-first functionality (initial phase)

## Success Criteria

1. Application runs successfully on both iOS and Android
2. Native features work as expected
3. Type safety is maintained throughout the codebase
4. Build process is automated and reliable
5. Development workflow is documented and reproducible
