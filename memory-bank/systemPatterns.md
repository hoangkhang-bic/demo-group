# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

- Vite-based TypeScript application
- Modern web application architecture

## Design Patterns

[To be documented as patterns emerge in development]

## Component Structure

[To be defined with component hierarchy]

## Data Flow

[To be defined with data flow patterns]

## Code Organization

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality enforcement
- Modular component structure

## Technical Decisions

- Using Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Bun as the package manager for faster dependency management

## Best Practices

- Type safety first approach
- Component-based architecture
- Clean code principles
- Modern ES6+ features

Note: This document will evolve as system patterns and architectural decisions are made.
